\initial{W}\textbf{e aim to make myschool more accessible to mobile clients by providing a native 
    application for use with Apple's popular iOS operating system. The application shows information
on upcoming classes, due assignments and grades achieved in an easily consumed format and simplifies
the life of the highly mobile student. The problem we set out to solve was that accessing myschool 
on a mobile device was very difficult. The login process requires entering of the username and 
password on each visit and no way to store it in the browser. In addition the UI lends itself quite
poorly to small screens, and information is higly ilegible. At a time when students demand easy
and always-available access to information it is apparent to us that our solution adds significant
value to myschool.}

\section*{Introduction}

This report details the work done by the authors in the fall term of 2014. This work was done
as an undergraduate research opportunity (UROP). The authors are students at Reykjavik University
in their last year of studies for a B.Sc. in software engineering. Kári and Björn are the authors
of a previous version of the myschool app created in 2013. We set out to solve the problem of 
making myschool easier to access and more pleasant to use on a mobile device. The current state
of the system is such that accessing information pertaining to ones studies is very tedious when not
situated in front of a desktop computer, making for frustrated students. 

Our solution is an application for the iOS mobile operating system that makes all the relevant 
information available instantly and in an easily digestible format.

%------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{The iSchool App}

The app is a native iOS application written in Apple's new programming language Swift.
We use native Cocoa Touch controls to present a familiar user interface that ties in well with
the rest of the operating system.

The app provides the following subset of myschool functionality, selected for it's relevance to
the mobile user.
\begin{itemize}
    \item View schedule for the week.
    \item A list of due assignments, and their status.
    \item Grades achieved during the semester.
    \item Málið's menu for the week.
\end{itemize}

Myschool does not currently present an API to program against, so the only option available to us
is to parse the HTML page and extract relevant information. This presents some problems, as it's 
impossible to make such an approach very robust, and the slightest change in how myschool presents
it's data could break our application. There is little we can do to remedy that situation, and we
rely on the fact that it's highly unlikely that myschool will change much in the foreseeable future.

Having said that, there were two options open to us. We could create a web application that handles
the parsing of myschool and presents an API to the mobile client. Choosing this route would mean that
we could simply update the web application to handle changes in myschool without breaking the 
clients. We decided against this approach as it comes with it's own set of drawbacks. We would have
to keep track of and store user credentials in a database, which we feel is both dishonest to our
fellow students and means we would have to shoulder a great deal of responsibility. It would also 
complicate the project and potentially make it infeasible to complete within the time frame.


%------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Roadmap}

In this report we will detail previous work done in this area, talk about the old myschool app
and what has changed. We will go into detail about the Swift programming language, why we chose it
and what our experience with it was like. We will tell the reader about the design of iSchool from
an architecture standpoint. We will also give a report of the work done and the development process,
and finally present suggestions for future work and improvements.
